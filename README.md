# About this product
Meditrack is a complete answer to the needs of a 21st century patient. In your busy life, you often forgot to take your important pill. Meditrack aims to eradicate the problem of missing a dosage -- or taking a double dose because you forgot.

The project is divided into a native mobile application (for the patients) and a responsive web application (for the pharmacist).

The web application is a replacement for the boring billing software you often see at medical stores. We have improved it, with tons of new features and direct integration with the customersâ€™ meditrack mobile application. Pharmacists can process new orders, view already processed orders and keep track of new orders coming from customers.
